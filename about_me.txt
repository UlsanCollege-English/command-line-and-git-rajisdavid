I'm Raj Shekhar Tamang, a Nepalese citizen currently staying in Korea. Professionally, I am a computer IT student at Ulsan college and a part time worker.

Computer hardware engineers are responsible for designing, developing, and testing computer hardware components such as processors, memory devices, motherboards, and networking equipment. Like a computer hardware engineer, I also have a passion  to do research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers and a willingness to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.

Overall, I think I am a good personal fit for a computer hardware engineer because in the near future I will develop a combination of technical skills to research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as circuit boards.. To add, I enjoy solving complex technical problems related to computer systems and components.
